Swap space and time with a video version of the "slit-scan" effect!

I will add examples here later, but for now, let's skip straight into how to use this code. Don't worry if you aren't a coder and this looks intimidating; you should be able to follow these instructions step-by-step, even without any technical knowledge. If you do run into any problems, feel free to [reach out to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/YitziLitt).
## How to use
1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your computer (if you don't, you can download it at https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install git, if you haven't already (you can get it at https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Open Terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows), and copy-paste the following code: `git clone https://github.com/yitzilitt/Slitscanner.git`
4. Navigate to the repository folder, by typing `cd Slitscanner`
5. Download the required libraries with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the script you want to run by simply typing `python [insert filename of script you want to run here]` (for example, `python main.py`, which will apply the slitscan effect to a video or series of videos located at an [otherwise empty] folder of your choice)

That's it!

Note: I have only tested this on .mp4 video files, and am not sure if this will work for other file formats.
