I will add examples here later, but for now, let's skip straight into how to use this code. Don't worry if you aren't a coder and this looks intimidating; you should be able to follow these instructions step-by-step, even without any technical knowledge.:
## How to use
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer (if you don't, you can download it at https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install git, if you haven't already (you can get it at https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Open Terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows), and copy-paste the following code: `git clone https://github.com/yitzilitt/Slitscanner.git`
4. Navigate to the repository folder, by typing (something like) `cd Slitscanner`
5. Run the script you want to run by simply typing the name out.
